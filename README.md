# Takeaway
============

Overview
---------

This is my fourth week project at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/â€Ž).

The goal of the exercise is to create a takeaway system. It has a menu and it's able to send an sms with a confirmation for your successful order.

Here is a screenshot of the sms confirmation sent through Twilio Api.
