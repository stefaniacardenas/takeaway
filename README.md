# Takeaway
============

Overview
---------

This is my fourth week project at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/â€Ž).

The goal of the exercise is to create a takeaway system with a menu, able to send an sms confirmation after the checkout.

Here is a screenshot of the sms confirmation sent through Twilio Api.
